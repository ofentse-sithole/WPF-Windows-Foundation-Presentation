The program will ask the user to choose between renting accommodation or buying a property.IF the user chooses to rent accommodation, it will ask the user to input the monthly rental amount. If the user selects to buy a property, it will ask the user to input the purchase price of the property, total deposit, interest rate, and number of months to repay (between 240 and 360), and the program will calculate the monthly home loan repayment. If the monthly home loan repayment is more than a third of the userâ€™s gross monthly income, the software will alert the user that approval of the home loan is unlikely.
